Thank you for following the directions given in title of this document. 
Now, please also follow the following instructions:

Run the source.cpp file in any way that you want (an IDE, console, however).
Make sure that the source.cpp file and the foods.csv file are in the same folder in the directory.
The foods.csv file has all of the information about the foods, which is pretty important for the function of the project.

For the numbers on the barcodes, make sure you write the whole number. Include the small numbers on the ends too.
If that does not work and the last number is 0, then try dropping that last 0.

Or the database might just not have it in there!

Anyways, enjoy our project!

Best,
Justin, Victoria, and DeShaune
